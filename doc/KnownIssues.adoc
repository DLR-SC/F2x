== Mulit-dimensional INOUT arrays (Python)

There exists a fundamental problem with INOUT arrays. When passed in to a BIND(C) FORTRAN
routine, they automatically seem to be reordered. However, when they are written and
returned, they are in FORTRAN order again. The current solution is to pass them in FORTRAN
order so the returned result can be used.

There is an obvious solution to this problem by simply splitting the INOUT argument into
an IN and an OUT argument. This is however right now left to the exported code if desired.
