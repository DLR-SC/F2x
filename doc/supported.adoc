= Supported features

This document summarizes the supported features of FORTRAN. Most of the features are implemented in the different
templates, so there will be a section on every template there is.

== Type support

The following basic types are supported. 

[width="80%",options="header"]
|============================================
|Fortran type     |C type  |Comment
|INTEGER          |int     |
|REAL(8)          |double  |
|LOGICAL          |bool    |
|CHARACTER(__N__) |char *  |Only fixed length strings are allowed by now.
|============================================

There is also support for derived types. For best compatibility, memory management is left to FORTRAN. Instances
of derived types are opaque pointers in (i.e. void *) and can only be accessed using generated getter and setter
functions / routines.

== BIND-C-Support

The `_bindc.f90.t` provides a C-like interface to the FORTRAN code is as used by all other higher level templates.
Due to this fact, only features supported by this layer can also be supported by other layers. Although the
actual template is rather complex, it is important to support as much as possible on this level.

=== Derived data types

Derived data types are automatically wrapped. Fields, that are not supported (yet) are simply ignored. I.e. you
still can use the derived type but you cannot access those fields.

                              |DIMENSION(__N__)           |-    |-     |
                              |ALLOCATEABLE, DIMENSION(:) |-    |-     |
                              |POINTER                    |     |      |
|============================================

=== Subroutines

Subroutines can be wrapped. Make sure to list them in the [export] section of the wrapper configuration (i.e. the
*.f90-wrap file). The following dummy arguments are currently considered:
