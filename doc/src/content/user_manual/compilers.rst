Compilers
=========

F2x needs a working set of compilers to be fully functioning. This means you need to have compatible Fortran and C
compilers at hand. F2x relies on the build system of numpy ant its build support. If you are able to build numpy
extensions with your environment, you should be fine.

The main target of the development focusses on the Intel Fortran and GFortran compilers.
